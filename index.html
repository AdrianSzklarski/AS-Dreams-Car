        <h3>Year 1960</h3>
        <p>The 356 is the first car of the Porsche brand. However, before the
          war the Porsche construction bureau created
          the Porsche 114 project with a centrally located water-cooled V-10
          engine, which it planned to put into series
          production for the first time under the Porsche brand. The idea was
          torpedoed by the authorities of the Third
          Reich - so the project was finally adapted to the components of the
          series VW Garbus. This is how a model with
          an aerodynamic body made of aluminium - known as the Porsche Type 64 -
          was created in 3 copies. On the basis of
          this project, the Porsche Type 356 was built after World War II.</p>

    <h2> Porsche 911 993 </h2>
    <div class="about-us-box middle">

    <div class="about-us-text">
      <h3>Year 1997</h3>
      <p>The Porsche 993 is the internal designation for the Porsche 911 model
        manufactured and sold between January 1994 and early 1998 (model years
        1995–1998 in the United States), replacing the 964. Its
        discontinuation marked the end of air-cooled 911 models.

        The 993 was much improved over and quite different from its
        predecessor. According to Porsche, every part of the car was designed
        from the ground up, including the engine and only 20% of its parts
        were carried over from the previous generation. Porsche refers to
        the 993 as "a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also
        a visual perspective." Porsche's engineers devised a new
        light-alloy subframe with coil and wishbone suspension (an all new
        multi-link system, Weissach axle), putting behind the previous
        lift-off oversteer and making significant progress with the engine
        and handling, creating a more civilized car overall and providing an
        improved driving experience. The 993 was also the first 911 to
        receive a six speed transmission.

        The 993 had several variants, as its predecessors, varying in body
        style, engines, drivetrains, and included equipment. Power was
        increased by the addition of the VarioRam system, particularly in the
        midranges, and also resulted in more throttle noise at higher
        revolutions; as a consequence, it resulted in a 15% increase in power
        over its predecessor.

        The external design of the Porsche 993, penned by English designer
        Tony Hatter, retained the basic body shell architecture of the 964 and
        other earlier 911 models, but with revised exterior panels, with much
        more flared wheel arches, a smoother front and rear bumper design, an
        enlarged retractable rear wing, and teardrop mirrors.

        A 993 GT2 was used as the safety car during the 1995 Formula One
        season.</p>

    <div class="about-us-text">
      <h3>Year 2020</h3>
      <p>The factory-code 981 version made its debut at the 2012 Geneva Motor
        Show. The basic version has a 2.8-litre six-cylinder engine with 265
        hp, its maximum torque is 280 Nm. It is centrally arranged. With a
        weight of 1310 kg, the car accelerates to 100 km/h in 5.8 seconds [5.5
        with the PDK dual-clutch transmission]. Top speed is 264 km/h [262
        km/h PDK].

        The Boxster S is an upgraded version. In this version, the engine has
        315 hp. The car reaches 100 km/h in 5.1 seconds [4.8 seconds PDK] and
        accelerates to 280 km/h.

        In 2013, the car together with the Cayman model won the title of World
        Performance Car of the Year.

        In March 2014, Porsche unveiled a GTS (Gran Turismo Sport) version of
        the Boxster. The car is powered by a Boxer engine with 330 hp and a
        maximum torque of 370 Nm. The car in the version with a dual-clutch
        PDK transmission accelerates to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds. The car hits
        showrooms in May. Prices in Germany start at €69,949.

        In September 2014, Porsche unveiled the weakest version of the Boxster
        model. It is powered by a 2.7-litre six-cylinder engine with a maximum
        output of 211 hp. The engine allows the car to accelerate to 100 km/h
        in 6.4 seconds. The top speed is 245 km/.</p>
